        <h1>Chord Progression Visualizer</h1>
        <h4>by John Quinlan</h4>
        <h2>Sliders:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Progression length slider (upper left): use the slider to set the 
                length of your chord progression between 3 and 10, inclusive.</li>
            <li>Starting chord: Use the slider to toggle between any of the seven offered chords.</li>
            <li>Ending chord: Similarly to the starting chord slider-- the most nice-sounding 
                progressions often end with either I or vi, but feel free to try whatever you like! </li> 
            <li>Key: Use the key slider to transpose into any of the 12 major keys.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Visualization Options:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bubble visualizer: Simply one circle corresponding to each chord, 
                where each circle lights up when its chord is being played.</li>
            <li>Hexagon visualizer: Like the arrangement of keys on an accordion, this 
                option is intuitive in that triads appear as clusters. </li>
            <li>Piano visualizer: Visualizes the notes being played as they would 
                appear on a piano. </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Chord vs. Time tracer</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>This visualiztion plots the chords being played as a function of time. 
                Try generating different progressions to find connections between what you 
                hear and what you see. </li>
        </ol>
